# WebRTC-Demo

## Quick Start

Just double-click `index.html` in the folder, then a random room ID will be generated to this page. When other users enter the same room ID, then he/she can establish a video/text chat with you.

## Notice

When nobody has entered your room, you cannot send out text messages.
